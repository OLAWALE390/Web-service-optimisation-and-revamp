 You currently work for DIGITAL ECHOES who has been approached by ACUK to build ADDITIONALS 
COURSES to its Online Learning Portal called  The HUB.
 Advance Careers currently deliver courses with both Live Virtual and Online Materials (Videos, Training 
Materials and Template, Quiz etc.)
 The company recently added two additional courses (Data Science & Automation Testing) which are 
being delivered virtually. However, the new courses has not been added to The HUB. Leading to 
delivering course materials using WhatsApp and Google Drive.
 As a result, it is difficult for student to learn ahead of class or used for research. Secondly, potential 
students can NOT find these courses on the website, leaning to low enrolments.
 Another problem with the current system is that there is NO centralized system to access learning 
content (Videos, Training Materials).
 As a result, you have been asked to help develop additional course pages on the website and online learning page
